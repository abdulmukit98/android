 @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {

        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_list, container, false);

        runStopwatch(view);
        return view;
    }



1) when we use extra function such as runStopwatch,   to access view , we must pass (view)  in the function 

if we use getActivity() in function , the app will crash.
