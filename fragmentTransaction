1) we must add fragment once and the first time activity is created
 without this codition , this fragment is created every time the activity pause, destroy.
 that mean it will refresh the data



if (savedInstanceState == null){
                NewFragment newFragment = new NewFragment();
                newFragment.setId(id);

                FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
                fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.frame_layout, newFragment);
                fragmentTransaction.commit();

        }
